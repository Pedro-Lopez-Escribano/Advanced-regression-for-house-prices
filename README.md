# Advanced-regression-for-house-prices

The dataset compiles the characteristics of homes together with their sale prices, the objective is to create a regression model capable of predicting optimal prices 
for future homes.

As usual, I have tried different approaches, trying different transformations, different feature engineering techniques and an exhaustive search 
for the best hyperparameters for machine learning models. You can also find a lot of work in the visualization section,
with which you can easily understand how variables are distributed and related.
You will find fully commented cells, I have decided to keep them so that I can see some of the transformations tested,
but in this case they did not provide a better result in the models.

You can find this dataset in Kaggle.

If you have any questions or suggestions, do not hesitate to comment, I am always looking for knowledge :).
